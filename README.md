# TrainingProject3OC

Welcome to my personal and temporary repository for a study exercice.

Exercice was to create a game of labyrinth staring MacGyver, where the user control the hero to escape.
3 objects have to be found in the level before reaching the guard, those objects are randomly placed on the map.

This repository is not the final repository for the exercice, only an initial training before creating a cleaner repository.
The whole code is really clunky and will be greatly improved in the upcoming days.

Thank you for your understanding, have a nice day.
